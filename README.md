# Assignment Base Branch

## Introduction

This is the base branch of class assignments. You are expected to create a
separate branch for each assignment based on this branch. You MUST NOT create an
assignment branch from the main branch. To create a new assignment branch, run
this in your terminal:

```sh
git fetch origin/assignment && git checkout assignment/<your-assignment-name> origin/assignment
```

It is encouraged that you use the assignment name for easier identification.

When you finish your assignment and pushed to your own branch, add your the link
to your branch to the list below. This file use Markdown (which you should learn
if you haven't already), so to add a new element to the list, simply put:

```
- [<Your assignment name>](<your assignment link>)
```

# Assignment Base Branch

## Introduction

This is the base branch of class assignments. You are expected to create a
separate branch for each assignment based on this branch. You MUST NOT create an
assignment branch from the main branch. To create a new assignment branch, run
this in your terminal:

```sh
git fetch origin/assignment && git checkout assignment/<your-assignment-name> origin/assignment
```

It is encouraged that you use the assignment name for easier identification.
